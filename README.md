# Sacclient
What you can do:
- Start sac processes
- Claim / Complete processes
- List open tasks
- List completed tasks
- To complete cast you have to provide a signature, if not provided you are not able to finish the task step
- Adding external toast component to check how we can use external libs
  
ToDos:
- load task data also with NgRx
- Get current position when navigating in navbar
- Test NGRX to create a dynamic, central toaster
- Format the date
- Refactor URL literals
- Dont route claim -> just toast it
- Check tests (if I have to deal with shadowdom or not ...) * e2e?
- Add auth (later)
- Deep Dive (basics, naming conventions and so, creating own components, ...)
