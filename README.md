# Sacclient
## How to start this project:

I did not create a deployscript yet. So, just do a `npm install`, `npm start` and open the browser `http://localhost:4200/`.
To see "something", you have to start a process and switch to the open task view.

## Done:
- Start sac processes
- Claim / Complete processes
- List open tasks
- List completed tasks
- To complete cast you have to provide a signature, if not provided you are not able to finish the task step
- Adding external toast component to check how we can use external libs
- Popup this toast with NgRx
  
## ToDos:
- Landing page,
- Get current position when navigating in navbar
- Format the date
- Check tests (if I have to deal with shadowdom or not ...) * e2e?
- Deep Dive (basics, naming conventions and so, creating own components, ...)
- Refactorings like URL literals
- Add auth (later)
